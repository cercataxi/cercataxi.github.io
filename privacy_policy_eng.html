        Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@cerca.taxi">privacy@cerca.taxi</a></p>

    <h4>2. Types of data collected</h4>
    <p>During the use of the website or the app, we collect exclusively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temporary geolocation data</strong>: GPS position provided by the browser or device, with the user's
            prior authorization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other personal data (name, contact, ID, profiling cookies, etc.) is collected or processed.</p>

    <h4>3. Purposes of processing</h4>
    <p>Data is processed exclusively for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifying the user's position and showing available taxis nearby;</li>
        <li>Facilitating the contact request with the taxi driver.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Legal basis</h4>
    <p>Processing is based on the user's **consent**, expressed through the authorization to use location in the
        browser/device.</p>

    <h4>5. Data retention</h4>
    <p>Geolocation data is used in real-time and is not stored or saved in our systems.</p>
    <p>Once the session ends or the page/app is closed, all information is automatically deleted.</p>

    <h4>6. Communication to third parties</h4>
    <p>Data is not communicated to third parties, nor transferred to external parties or used for commercial purposes.
    </p>

    <h4>7. Data subject rights</h4>
    <p>Even without registration, the user has the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Receive confirmation of the temporary use of their data;</li>
        <li>Revoke consent for geolocation directly from the browser or device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Geolocation data processing (GPS and/or approximate position)</h4>
    <p>The use of geolocation by CERCA.TAXI complies with the principles of data minimization and storage limitation, as
        provided by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of processing</strong>: geolocation data is used exclusively to identify the user's position
            in order to show available taxis nearby and facilitate the contact request with the taxi driver.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal basis</strong>: processing is based on the user's consent, expressed through the authorization
            to use location in the browser or device.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing methods</strong>: position data is used in real-time and is not stored or saved in
            CERCA.TAXI systems. Once the session ends or the page/app is closed, all information is automatically
            deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharing with third parties</strong>: geolocation data is not communicated to third parties, nor
            transferred to external parties or used for commercial purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Data subject rights</strong>: the user has the right to revoke consent for geolocation at any time,
            directly from the browser or device settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These practices are in line with the guidelines provided by the Data Protection Authority, which emphasize the
        importance of processing geolocation data in a proportionate manner and limited to the specific purposes of the
        service.</p>

    <h4>9. How to disable geolocation</h4>
    <p>The user can at any time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refuse or revoke geolocation authorization from the browser or operating system;</li>
        <li>Continue using the site with limited functionalities (e.g., manual position entry).</li>
    </ul>
